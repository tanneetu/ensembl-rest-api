\title{Validate Genome Name Against Ensembl Species List Names}
\usage{
validate_genome_name(genome_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{genome_name}{A character string representing the genome name to validate.}
}
\value{
If the genome name is valid, it is returned as a lowercase string. If not found, an error
is raised, suggesting the closest possible matches.
}
\description{
This function validates a given genome name against the available species names in the Ensembl database.
If the genome name is found, it is returned in lowercase. Otherwise, the function computes the
Damerau-Levenshtein distance to suggest the closest matching species names.
Species names are fetched from the cache if available; otherwise, they are retrieved from the API
and cached for future use.
